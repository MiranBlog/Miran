:t: Title :t: - Title
:d: - date
:p: Example text :p: - new paragraph
:b: bold :b:
:i: italic :i: 

You can also add new commands by opening miran.py and in the add-on pasting this:
while ":letter:" in text:
    text = str(text);
    text = text.replace(":letter:","<letter>",1);
    text = text.replace(":letter:","</letter>",1); 
-- ofc by replacing the letter with a s , for example, which will get you strikethrough 


You can also just write plain html like:
 <b>This will be bold</b>
 <a href="https://github.com">click me</a>
and so on.
